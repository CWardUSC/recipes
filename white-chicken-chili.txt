White Chicken Chili

4 boneless/skinless chicken breasts (I use the Kirkland brand frozen breasts from Costco)
2 cans of chicken broth (14 oz)
2 tbsp lemon pepper
1 tbsp cumin
4 cloves of garlic (I use the pre-cut garlic, and add a heaping tbsp)
2 cans of great northern beans, drained (15.8 oz)
2 cans of white shoepeg corn, drained (11 oz)
2 cans of chopped green chiles (4 oz)
2 limes (juiced)

Tortilla chips, grated cheese, and any other toppings you’d like.
Add chicken broth, lemon pepper, cumin and garlic to your crock pot. I usually give it a little stir, and then add the chicken breasts. It’s ok if they aren’t covered completely with the liquid. I have always used frozen chicken breasts for this recipe. Cook on low 6 – 8 hours (cooking it longer than 8 hours is fine). Remove chicken from crock pot and chop into bite sized pieces. Return chicken to crock pot along with beans, corn, chiles, and lime juice. Cook until heated through. If you’re in a hurry, turn pot up to high, and it should be done within 10 minutes. Serve!
